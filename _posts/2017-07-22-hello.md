title: Hello!

Here we go! First post! At the risk of repeating myself only once, I am Qasim Javed. I work in the tech industry in the bay area as a Software Engineer. My background is in Distributed Systems and Wireless Networking protocols. However, I love to learn and experiment with all kinds of stuff. This blog will serve two purposes:
- Serve as a documentation for myself to refer back to the various things that I do
- Making the above information widely available for cross pollination
